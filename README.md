## ‚ú® Key Features

This replica implements several dynamic, portfolio-worthy features:

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Seamless layout transformation with dedicated CSS rules for mobile and desktop screens, including a functional mobile hamburger menu.

- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: The Skills Bars animate the width percentage only when the section enters the viewport, demonstrating the use of the Intersection Observer API.
